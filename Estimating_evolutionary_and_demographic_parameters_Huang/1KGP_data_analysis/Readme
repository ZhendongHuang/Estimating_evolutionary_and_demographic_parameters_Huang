The raw-data of Chromosome 20 and Chromosome 21 of the eight populations are download from ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk. Then they are encoded into the TS.samples format of the tskit tool, following "https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi8264" (also see "https://github.com/awohns/unified_genealogy_paper" for the code). Once the resulting .samples file for the two chromosomes are renamed as "tgp_chr20.samples and tgp_chr21.samples", implment the .py scripts in this directory for analysis of each population.
